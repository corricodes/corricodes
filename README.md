- 👋 Hi, I’m @corricodes
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development, and eventually learning the back-end stuff to gain a full understanding of everything
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, Vue & Angular
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing at the moment, just learning and job searching
- 📫 How to reach me - will add this later as I don't have anything set up yet
